                <h1>About the site:</h1>
                <p>
                    Oh hey it's you! I've been waiting for you to arrive!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is Truddy, I've created this website so that you can collect stickers of my friends and I. We're all pretty cool, so I'm sure you'll love us!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Build Your Sticker Album!</h2>
                <p>
                    The concept is simple. You've got an album. Every day, you'll get a new pack of stickers for free. These are then meant to be stuck into your album on specific pages. What kind of stickers? Well, that's up for you to find out!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll discover a variety of stickers! Some feature for example characters or items as single images, while others are part of a puzzle set. You'll collect all the pieces to unveil a larger, complete image.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Duplicates & Swapping</h2>
                <p>
                    You might possilby recieve a sticker that you already have. That's okay, it happens! 
                </p>
                <p>                
                    But that's when it becomes fun: you can swap stickers with other people, friends. If you have a sticker that someone else wants, and they have a sticker that you want, you can swap them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also convert them into coins, which you can use to buy more packs, but... that's less fun.
                </p>
            </div>
